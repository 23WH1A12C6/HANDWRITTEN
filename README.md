Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project uses a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using TensorFlow and Keras. It can be trained on the MNIST dataset or a custom dataset of handwritten digits.

Features
Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits.
Predict digit classes from images.
Evaluate model performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/handwritten-recognition.git
cd handwritten-recognition
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset. You can also provide your own dataset of handwritten digits.

Usage
Training the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Testing with custom images:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of ~99% on the MNIST test dataset.
